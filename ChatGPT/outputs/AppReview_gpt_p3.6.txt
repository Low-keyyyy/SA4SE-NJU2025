{"text": "its nice this apps is must lovely", "res": "In a general context, the words \"nice\", \"must\", and \"lovely\" might indicate a positive sentiment. However, in the software engineering context, it is important to carefully analyze terms because they might differ based on domain-specific uses. The text does not contain any identified technical context cues or neutralizers, suggesting that the sentiment could primarily be interpreted based on the general language without modification.\n\nBy evaluating the text without domain-specific adaptation: \"nice\" and \"lovely\" are positive descriptors, suggesting the sentiment is likely intended to be positive.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment of the text is \"positive\"."}
