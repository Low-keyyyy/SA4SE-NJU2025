I think I found the issue!``` can be interpreted as \"positive\". Although it contains the phrase \"tricky shit,\" which could carry a negative connotation in general contexts, in software engineering, such expressions are often used colloquially to describe challenging problems.

{"text": "Hi Carlos, This looks awesome! Lots of cool stuff.", "res": "Positive"}
{"text": "sorry, this bug is *not* fixed.", "res": "In this context, the sentiment of the software engineering text is \"neutral.\" In software engineering, terms like \"bug\" and statements about whether something is \"fixed\" are typically descriptive rather than emotional. Thus, the statement is a factual observation rather than expressing a specific sentiment."}
{"text": "This way lies metadata hell.", "res": "Negative"}
{"text": "sorry about this.", "res": "In the context of software engineering texts, the sentiment of the phrase \"sorry about this\" would be considered \"neutral.\" This is because the expression is often used in technical contexts to acknowledge an issue or error without necessarily conveying a strong negative sentiment, especially when the speaker is merely reporting or addressing a technical situation."}

{"text": "Here is quite bad.", "res": "To accurately assess the sentiment of the software engineering text \"Here is quite bad,\" context is crucial. In general, this phrase alone without additional context suggests a negative sentiment due to the word \"bad.\" However, within a technical context, where it may refer to a non-emotional assessment (e.g., bad code quality, poor performance), the sentiment might be neutral or context-dependent.\n\nGiven the lack of specific context here and the directive to use domain-specific understanding, the sentiment could be \"neutral\" if it pertains to a technical evaluation devoid of emotional connotation. However, if taken at face value in a generic context or if no such contextual domain-specific markers are present to neutralize the term, it might suggest \"negative.\"\n\nSince the example phrase is extremely brief and devoid of surrounding technical context, adhering to a conservative interpretation as explicitly linguistic without domain-specific cues (and given that I lack additional context detail), I would classify it as \"negative.\""}
