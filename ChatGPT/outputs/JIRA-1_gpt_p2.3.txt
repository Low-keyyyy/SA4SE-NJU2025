{"text": "I haven't had any time to try re-upgrading after having to back out 2.0.8, but I will be sure to let you know how it works out as soon as I get the opportunity.", "res": "To determine the sentiment of the given software engineering text, we need to take into account the mentions of emotions and attitudes in the context of software discussions. The text mentions not having had the time to try something again after having to \"back out\" of version 2.0.8. The phrase \"back out\" in this context suggests an action taken to undo or reverse a previous state, often due to issues or problems. However, it's also mentioned that the speaker intends to revisit and report on the task as soon as possible. Despite the mention of a setback, there is no strong expression of frustration or satisfaction; instead, it indicates a neutral stance focused on future action rather than on any positive or negative emotions. Therefore, the sentiment of the given SE text can be considered \"neutral.\""}

This typically indicates a lack of concern or indifference.\n5. **Stopwords and Stemming:** The sentence doesn't need adjustments here for basic sentiment interpretation.\n\nInterpreting the sentence after considering the negation: The speaker expresses indifference regarding the prettiness of something but emphasizes a need for basic functionality in a specific browser, which they've not used in years. The phrase \"I don't care\" indicates a neutral attitude overall. The context doesn't show any strong positive or negative emotion towards the situation described.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment of the provided text is **neutral**."}
