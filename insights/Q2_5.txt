The paper highlights that sentiment expressions in software engineering texts differ due to technical jargon, which poses challenges for general sentiment analysis tools. Emotions in SE are often implicit or obscured by domain-specific language, making it necessary to incorporate SE-related data to capture these unique expressions accurately.

The paper proposes SEntiMoji, an approach using emojis as noisy sentiment labels to enhance sentiment analysis in software engineering (SE) texts. It tackles the challenge of scarce labeled SE data by leveraging emoji-labeled posts from both Twitter and GitHub, which supply technical jargon and general sentiment patterns respectively. This dual-source strategy allows for learning sentiment-aware representations that improve analysis quality. The study emphasizes the importance of capturing general sentiment expressions from non-technical domains alongside domain-specific resources to effectively analyze sentiment in SE-related texts.
