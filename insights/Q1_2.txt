The paper proposes an approach named SESSION (SentEnce-Structure-based SentIment analysis for sOftware eNgineering) to analyze sentiment in software engineering (SE) texts. Unlike traditional methods that rely on domain-specific sentiment dictionaries, SESSION focuses on utilizing sentence structures to better identify and assess sentiment expressions in SE texts. The approach consists of three steps: (1) preprocessing and segmenting SE texts into clauses using NLP tools; (2) applying filter rules to identify clauses that likely express sentiments, based on patterns like direct sentiment, decorated sentiment, "about me," and "judgment"; (3) using adjust rules to enhance sentiment analysis, addressing aspects like negation and polysemous words, and ignoring certain sentence structures like subjunctive mood. The evaluation of SESSION on multiple datasets indicates improved accuracy and generalizability over existing methods.
