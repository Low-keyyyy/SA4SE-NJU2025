Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial for accurate sentiment analysis in software engineering because technical texts often contain domain-specific terms with neutral or positive meanings, which generic sentiment tools might misinterpret, leading to unreliable sentiment analysis results.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering sentiment analysis, researchers need to focus on context and vocabulary. Technical text often includes domain-specific terms, precise language, and factual descriptions centered on technical aspects or tasks. In contrast, sentiment expressive text may contain subjective terms, emotional language, and personal opinions reflecting developers' attitudes or feelings. Utilizing domain-specific datasets and custom sentiment analysis tools tailored for software engineering semantics can enhance the accuracy of differentiating between the two text types, acknowledging the distinct meanings technical terms may convey in this context.
