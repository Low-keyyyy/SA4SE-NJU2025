The paper "SentiStrength-SE: Exploiting domain specificity for improved sentiment analysis in software engineering text" presents a tool, SentiStrength-SE, designed to analyze sentiments in software engineering texts. The tool addresses inaccuracies found in general sentiment analysis tools by employing a software engineering domain-specific dictionary and contextual heuristics. The authors first conduct a qualitative study to identify the challenges in the current sentiment analysis of software engineering texts, highlighting domain-specific issues as significant factors. They then build a domain-specific sentiment dictionary and integrate it with SentiStrength-SE, adding heuristics for context-sensitive interpretations. The tool is tested using benchmark datasets of JIRA issue comments, showing it consistently outperforms existing domain-independent tools like SentiStrength, NLTK, and Stanford NLP in determining the sentiment in software engineering texts. The process involves preprocessing, using enhanced contextual detection, and a custom domain dictionary to improve accuracy in identifying positive, negative, and neutral sentiments.
