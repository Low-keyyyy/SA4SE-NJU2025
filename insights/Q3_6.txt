Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical terms may carry sentimental connotations in general language but are neutral in the software engineering context. This domain specificity leads to inaccuracies when employing general sentiment analysis tools without adaptation to software engineering texts.

The paper highlights several challenges in distinguishing technical descriptive text from sentiment-expressive text in software engineering contexts. It emphasizes creating a domain-specific dictionary that neutralizes technical terms, which could otherwise be misclassified due to their emotional connotations in general contexts. Additionally, it employs contextual cues by considering pronouns and neutralizers preceding potentially sentimental words. This approach helps resolve ambiguities where words might carry different meanings based on usage context. Moreover, pre-processing steps like filtering out code snippets, URLs, and numeric values are used to reduce noise and misclassification from technical content that doesn't convey true sentiment.
