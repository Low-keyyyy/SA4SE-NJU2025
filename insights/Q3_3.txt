Technical descriptive text often includes jargon, code snippets, and structure-specific content that might not carry sentiment, whereas sentiment-expressive text conveys emotions or opinions. Differentiating them ensures accurate sentiment analysis, as conventional tools misinterpret technical text as lacking sentiment or conveying unintended emotions.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering contexts, the paper recommends using data preprocessing steps to handle domain-specific features. This includes expanding contractions, removing URLs and code snippets, handling emoticons by replacing them with sentiment-descriptive words, and applying negation handling techniques to accurately capture sentiment polarity. Additionally, leveraging syntactic parsing (e.g., parts-of-speech tagging and chunking) can help differentiate sentiment-expressing words from technical descriptors. By applying these customizations, sentiment analysis tools can better identify and interpret the sentiment conveyed in SE texts amidst technical jargon.
