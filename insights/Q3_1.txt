Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering texts is crucial because technical text conveys factual information, while sentiment text reflects developers' emotions and opinions, impacting productivity, collaboration, and software quality. Proper analysis enhances understanding of developers' sentiment and project dynamics.

To distinguish between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering, the paper suggests preprocessing techniques such as stop words removal and leveraging sentiment analysis tools like SentiSW. The aim is to identify subjective text containing sentiments by focusing on features indicative of sentiment, using machine learning models for classification, and applying rules for entity recognition. Emoticons and specific words like "thank" or "sorri" signal sentiment, while technical text often contains code snippets or domain-specific terminologies lacking emotional expressions. Sentence structure, punctuation, and contextual indicators also aid in the differentiation process.
