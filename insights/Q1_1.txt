The paper outlines a method for sentiment analysis specifically tailored for software engineering texts by developing a tool called SentiSW. It emphasizes entity-level sentiment analysis, which involves identifying sentiments directed towards specific entities, such as people ("Person") or projects ("Project"). The approach starts by constructing a large, manually labeled dataset of issue comments from GitHub. SentiSW utilizes supervised machine learning techniques for sentiment classification, achieving higher accuracy than general sentiment tools by applying preprocessing steps like tokenization and stemming. For feature extraction, it uses TF-IDF and Doc2vec methods. Sentiment is categorized into positive, negative, or neutral, and entities are recognized using a rule-based method that leverages named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging. The system's efficacy is evaluated using metrics like precision, recall, f-measure, and accuracy, demonstrating superior performance in identifying sentiment polarity and entities compared to existing tools.
