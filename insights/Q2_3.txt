Software engineering texts often differ from general texts by containing technical jargon, word contractions, emoticons, URLs, and code snippets. These unique elements require customized sentiment analysis tools for accurate evaluation, as they can obscure sentiment and are not adequately handled by tools designed for non-technical domains.

To effectively analyze sentiment in software engineering texts, the paper suggests several preprocessing steps. These steps include expanding word contractions to their full forms, removing URLs and code snippets, handling emoticons by converting them into sentiment-representative words, and carefully addressing negations by modifying the context of affected words using a chunk grammar. Additionally, the paper recommends excluding non-semantic stopwords and applying word stemming to reduce words to their base forms. These preprocessing measures help transform technical and context-heavy SE texts into formats more suitable for sentiment analysis.
