In software engineering texts, sentiment expressions differ from general texts due to the inclusion of code snippets, technical terminologies, and specific communication styles, which necessitate domain-specific sentiment analysis tools. Sentiments are often conveyed through issue comments, mailing lists, and code reviews, focusing on both emotional and technical content.

The paper emphasizes the need for domain-specific sentiment analysis tools for software engineering texts due to their unique characteristics, such as code snippets, terminologies, and abbreviations, which differ from typical consumer reviews or social media texts. Key steps include preprocessing texts by removing non-English characters, expanding contractions, and eliminating code snippets, URLs, and certain punctuation marks. It also involves identifying emoticons, applying negation marking, and stemming words. The paper highlights using customized machine learning models over general tools, focusing on entity-level sentiment analysis to identify sentiments directed towards entities like 'Person' or 'Project'.
