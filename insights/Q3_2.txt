Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering texts is crucial because SE texts often use complex structures and indirect expressions. This differentiation helps avoid misleading sentiment analysis results by filtering out non-sentimental clauses, enhancing the accuracy of detecting genuine sentiments.

The paper proposes distinguishing between technical descriptive and sentiment expressive text in software engineering (SE) by leveraging sentence structures and specific patterns. It suggests using filter rules to identify sentences likely to express sentiment, like those containing exclamation marks, emojis, or sentimental words. Additionally, it employs sentence segmentation and part-of-speech tagging to ignore neutral clauses, such as subjunctive or technical descriptions. By focusing on context and structural patterns, irrelevant technical details can be filtered out, enhancing the identification of genuine sentiment in SE texts.
