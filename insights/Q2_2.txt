The paper identifies that sentiment expression in software engineering texts is more indirect and dispersed than in social texts. SE texts often feature complex sentence structures, use technical language, and describe issues analytically before expressing sentiment, making it challenging for conventional sentiment analysis tools to accurately interpret them.

To handle software engineering texts when analyzing sentiment, the paper proposes a sentence-structure-based approach named SESSION. This approach involves preprocessing and segmenting the text into clauses using Stanford CoreNLP, applying filter rules to identify and exclude non-sentimental clauses, and then using adjust rules to refine sentiment analysis. The filter rules check for specific patterns indicative of sentiment, while the adjust rules consider sentence structures, such as recognizing subjunctive mood and polysemous words. This method improves sentiment analysis by acknowledging the indirect and complex expression of sentiments in software engineering texts.
