The paper proposes a specialized sentiment analysis classifier, Senti4SD, specifically designed for software engineering texts. Unlike off-the-shelf sentiment tools, Senti4SD is tailored for software developers' communication, such as Stack Overflow posts. It utilizes lexicon-based features extracted from a sentiment lexicon, keyword-based features from uni- and bi-grams within the dataset, and semantic features leveraging distributional semantic models built via word embedding with word2vec. The goal is to address misclassification issues, particularly the negative bias in which neutral technical documents are often wrongly classified as negative due to the presence of technical jargon or reports. Senti4SD demonstrated improved precision and recall over existing tools by accounting for the unique context and language of software engineering discourse. The classifier undergoes supervised machine learning using a curated and manually annotated gold standard, providing a balanced assessment of positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.
