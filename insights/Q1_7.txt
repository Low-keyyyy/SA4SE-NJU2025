The paper highlights that standard sentiment analysis tools often fall short in software engineering (SE) contexts due to domain-specific language nuances. To address this, researchers propose customized methods specifically tailored for SE. These include supervised and distant supervision learning approaches that use SE-related annotated datasets. The study evaluates these methods in three settings: within-dataset, within-platform, and cross-platform. Findings suggest that while SEntiMoji, a distant supervision method, outperforms traditional supervised learning techniques in various settings, it shows no clear advantage over dictionary-based methods like SentiStrength-SE in platform-specific and cross-platform evaluations. For practical applications, the paper recommends creating and annotating datasets that align with specific SE tasks for better accuracy, and using SEntiMoji for high-accuracy needs, or SentiStrength-SE when time and resources are limited.
