The distinction between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text is crucial because technical texts often contain jargon that can be misclassified as sentiment-laden by off-the-shelf tools, leading to errors in understanding developers' actual emotions or intentions, especially when reporting issues or requesting help.

The paper highlights the challenge of distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment-expressive text in software engineering due to the negative bias of existing sentiment analysis tools. To address this, the Senti4SD classifier is introduced, leveraging lexicon-based, keyword-based, and semantic features, particularly word embeddings trained on software-specific data. These features help understand the context and correct misclassifications of neutral technical texts often misinterpreted as negative due to technical terms like "kill" and "missing." The approach emphasizes understanding word usage within its domain-specific context to accurately distinguish sentiment.
