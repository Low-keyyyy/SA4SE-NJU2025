The paper describes developing a customized sentiment analysis tool called SentiCR, specifically for code review interactions in the Software Engineering (SE) domain. Existing sentiment analysis tools, primarily designed for social media and product reviews, perform poorly on SE texts due to their unique characteristics, such as technical jargon, emoticons, and code snippets. SentiCR addresses this by using a supervised learning approach with data preprocessing steps like expanding contractions, handling negations, removing URLs, and preprocessing emoticons. It converts review comments into a feature vector using TF-IDF for model training. SentiCR was tested using various supervised learning algorithms, and Gradient Boosting Tree (GBT) achieved the best accuracy. The study highlights the importance of domain-specific adaptations to improve sentiment analysis accuracy in SE settings, leveraging a manually labeled sentiment dataset for validation.
