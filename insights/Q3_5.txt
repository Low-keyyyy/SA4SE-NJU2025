Distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text in software engineering is essential because technical jargon can lead to misinterpretations when applying standard sentiment analysis tools, potentially resulting in unreliable sentiment assessments of developers' emotions and opinions within the context of software development activities.

The paper suggests that a major challenge in analyzing sentiment for software engineering (SE) texts is distinguishing between technical descriptive text and sentiment expressive text. It highlights that traditional sentiment analysis tools often misclassify due to misunderstanding domain-specific terms or technical jargon. To address this, SEntiMoji employs emotional emojis from large-scale social media data as noisy sentiment labels. This helps learn general sentiment patterns and contextual meaning, enabling the model to better handle technical expressions and capture sentiments by training on SE-specific datasets with combined emoji-based representation learning. This integrated approach improves sentiment analysis accuracy in SE contexts.
